# Matrix Admin Python Library
This is a simple library for functions that I use with my Matrix-Server. The library provides basic functions and I use it with Juypter Notebooks.
It provides an matrix_server object.

## Functions provided:
- login
- load_config
- save_config
- set_access_token
- get_room_id_from_alias
- get_users_from_room
- get_rooms
- get_users
- new_user
- deactivate_user
- reset_password
- get_joined_rooms
- get_user_devices


I usually use the functions with an Jupyter notebook. I'm working on a GUI and will add more functions as I need them for administration of a matrix sserver. 

Any feedback is appreciated.
